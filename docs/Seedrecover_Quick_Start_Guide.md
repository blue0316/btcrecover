# *seedrecover.py* #

*seedrecover.py* is a Bitcoin seed recovery tool which can take a seed with one or more mistakes in it, and recover the correct seed if not too many mistakes have been made.


## Installation ##

Just download the latest version from <https://github.com/gurnec/btcrecover/archive/master.zip> and unzip it to a location of your choice.

Additional requirements are described below.

Note that *seedrecover.py* uses Armory (Bitcoin wallet software) to accelerate the Eliptic Curve math it needs to perform; you do not need to start Armory for any reason.

### Windows ###

 1. Follow [these instructions](INSTALL.md#python-27) to download and install Python 2.7.

 2. Visit this page to download Armory for Windows: <https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/releases>. If you installed the 64-bit version of Python, download the latest version of Armory ending in `.exe` (but avoid any `Pre-release` versions). If you installed the 32-bit version of Python, download a **0.93.x** version of Armory ending in `.exe`.

 3. Double-click the downloaded file to install Armory.

### Linux ###

Because Armory has a number of dependencies, installing it on Linux isn't always easy. For Debian-like distributions, a shell script has been provided (in the same directory as this README file) which will automatically download and install Armory along with all of its required dependencies. Simply run it from a terminal window:

    bash install-armory.sh

Alternatively you can manually download and install the latest version of Armory from here (but avoid any `Pre-release` versions): <https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/releases>.

### OS X ###

 1. Download the latest version of Armory for `osx` from here: <https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/releases> (but avoid any `Pre-release` versions).

 2. Open your Downloads, and double-click the Armory file to decompress it.

 3. Drag the new Armory app into your Applications folder (just to the left, in the sidebar).

Please also read the OS X section below.

## Running *seedrecover.py* ##

In order to run *seedrecover.py*, you'll need two things:

 1. A good estimate of what your seed is.

 2. *One* of the following, in order of preference:
     1. for Electrum (1.x or 2.x), a copy of your wallet file,
     2. your master public key,
     3. or a receiving address that was generated by your wallet from your seed, along with a good estimate of how many addresses you created before the receiving address you'd like to use.

        **Note** that seed recovery based on receiving addresses is not currently supported on OS X.

Actually running *seedrecover.py* on Windows or Linux is simple: just double-click it. If you're given an option between running it in a terminal or without one, choose *Run in Terminal*. Then, just answer the on-screen questions.

### OS X ###

Running *seedrecover.py* (or *btcrecover* with Armory support) is not quite as easy.

To run *seedrecover.py*, you must use the version of Python which is included with Armory. Open a terminal window (open the Launchpad and search for "terminal"), `cd` to the directory where the `seedrecover.py` script is, and then run it using the full path. Below is an example, note that the first line may differ if the `seedrecover.py` script is in a different location.

    cd Downloads/btcrecover-master
    /Applications/Armory.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python seedrecover.py

The first window which appears will be a file selection window. If you have an Electrum wallet file, choose it now. If not, click `Cancel` to continue the process.

For `btcrecover` users, the process is similar. You must use the full path:

    /Applications/Armory.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python btcrecover.py [other-options...]
